<h1> Decision-Tree-Implementation</h1>
Building a Decision Tree classifier from scratch :-)
The decision tree has been built from scratch .The PDF files contain the actual tree implementation.Printing steps for every split in the decision tree for the iris dataset.
At last there is a comparision done using the inbuilt sklearn Decision tree and comparing it with our model on the same dataset.

## Python environment 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ayanava-99/Decision-Tree-Implementation/blob/master/Decision%20Tree%20Implementation.ipynb)
A Colab-compatible repo with a `requirements.txt` file.



## Notes
If you still insist to run it on your PC, well the `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that the notebook
depends on, please install them in a virtual env using:

```
$ conda create --name newenv --file requirements.txt
```
